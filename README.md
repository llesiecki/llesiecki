Hi, I’m Łukasz Lesiecki.  
My passion is creating various projects combining computer science and electronics.  
I have a solid experience in the modern C++ and C (also in programming microcontrollers). 
Languages from the C-family are my favorite because I really like writing some high-performance stuff (and fighting for single bytes in the case of microcontrollers).
I also like to write in Python because it’s so flexible, and it’s pretty easy to do complex tasks with all these modules that are easily accessible.
