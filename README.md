Hi, I’m Łukasz Lesiecki.  
My passion is creating various projects combining computer science and electronics.  
I have a solid experience in the modern C++ and C (also in programming microcontrollers). 
Languages from the C-family are my favorite because I really like writing some high-performance stuff (and fighting for single bytes in the case of microcontrollers).
I also like to write in Python because it’s so flexible, and it’s pretty easy to do complex tasks with all these modules that are easily accessible.
# My Projects

## Gauss Rifle
(also known as a coilgun) It is a type of weapon that uses a really strong magnetic field instead of explosives to accelerate the bullet. The bullet is made of steel, but it can be any ferromagnetic material. In this case it's the tip of a thick nail 4 cm long. It has a bank of three capacitors (450V, 1900uF) for powering the coil. After pulling the trigger, the thyristor is powered (1600V, 1.2kA) and a large current flows through it from the capacitor bank to the coil. When the coil is powered, it attracts the bullet and accelerates it to high speed. In the meantime, the capacitor bank is discharging, so the coil is no longer powered, and the bullet will not be braked by it. The rifle has a Li-ion battery (14.8V, 4.4Ah) which is used to charge the capacitor bank. Recharging process is performed by a self-made DC-DC step up converter, which is able to charge the capacitors up to 400V.
